    "(a.) What is the area of the triangles $\\triangle(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ and $\\triangle(p_4, p_5, p_6)$? (2p)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the area of the first $\\triangle(p_1, p_2, p_3)$, WLOG, we subtract $p_1$ from all points so that we have one of the points at the origin. This is possible since translations don't affect area. This means we can define $\\tilde{p}_1 = (0,0), \\tilde{p}_2 = (0,1), \\tilde{p}_3 = (-2,-3)$. Next we recall that we can take the cross product of the two vectors scaled by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to find the area.\n",

    "&= 1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is an easy example, we could also visualize the points. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are one unit apart, our base is 1. Similarly, since $p_2$ and $p_3$ differ by two units, the height is 2, so using the standard formula, $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(2) = 1$, we see we arrive at the same answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using the exact same technique as before, we find the area of $\\triangle(p_4, p_5, p_6)$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    A_\\triangle(p_4, p_5, p_6) &= A_\\triangle(0, p_5-p_4, p_6-p_4)\\\\\n",

    "    &= \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{vmatrix} 3 & -6\\\\ -1 & -4\\end{vmatrix}\\\\\n",
    "    &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left((3)(-4) - (-6)(-1)\\right)\\\\\n",
    "    &= |-9|\\\\\n",
    "    &= 9\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This was independently verified by using the points to find the $\\ell^2$ distance between them, then from this applying Heron's theorem which is:\n",

    "A_\\triangle(a,b,c) &= \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},\n",

    "where $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semi-perimeter. This nasty calculations, expidited by Wolfram Alpha, also confirmed that $A_\\triangle(p_4,p_5,p_6) = 9$."
